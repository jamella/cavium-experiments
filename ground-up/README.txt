This is my attempt to create a working program to generate, send, and receive
packets that can be built with a minimal Makefile (i.e. one without a bunch of
junk that got copied over from an example's Makefile). It will likely replace
latency-test eventually. Basically, I'm trying to take a very incrememntal
approach to write something that works and that I fully understand.
